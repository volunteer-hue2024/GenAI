# GenAI

* Limitations of LLM
1. "what is the cheapest flight for tomoro to delhi" --fails because trained only until a cut off date
2. "can you order a pizza" --- fails bcoz it cannot "do" a task or workflow

 * AI Agent 
 > Cheapest flight for tomoro to delhi --- gets info after fetching data , from say makemytrip too

* Difference between AI Agent and Agentic AI
> Agentic AI is combining many AI agents.
> Not just Q and A.
> Autonomous ie Without human interference.
>
* Input prompt > Reasoning > Planning( the sequence including payment may be planned)

* CREW AI

- AS lANGCHAIN IS TO RAG , crew AI is to AI agent
- structured system encompassing agnets,process and tasks and outcomes

* CREW AI ARCHITECTURE
- Define all Agents
- Defne tasks
- Execution
>Crew Formation
>Output

a. AI agents collaborate,communicate and delegate tasks among themselves
b. "Process" organizes these interactions determining how tasks are managed
  1. Sequential process : task need to be performed in a particular sequence .Without task 1 task 2 is not followed
  2. Hierarchical process :
c. Crew

AI **Ordering pizza**
