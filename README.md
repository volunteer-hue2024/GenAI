# GenAI

* Limitations of LLM
> what is the cheapest flight for tomorro to delhi --fails because trained only until a cut off date
> can you order a pizza --- fails bcoz it cannot "do" a task or workflow

 * AI Agent 
 > Cheapest flight for tomoro to delhi --- gets info after fetching data from say make my trip too

* Difference between AI Agent and Agentic AI
 > Agentic AI is combining many AI agents
> Not just Q and A
> Autonomous ie Without human interference
>
> Input prompt > Reasoning > Planning( the sequence including payment may be planned)

* CREW AI

>AS lANGCHAIN IS TO RAG is crew AI is to AI agent
>structured system encompassing agnets,prcess and tasks and outcomes

* CREW AI ARCHITECTURE
>Define all Agents
>Defne tasks
>Execution
>Crew Formation
>Output
