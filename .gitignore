A `.gitignore` file is your first line of defense in AI engineering. It tells Git to **ignore** specific files so they never leave your local machine.

For your agentic project, you need to hide your **API keys** (`.env`), your **Python virtual environment** (`venv/`), and any **temporary cache** files generated by the LLMs.

### 📄 The Ultimate `.gitignore` for AI Agents

Create a file named `.gitignore` (with the dot at the start) in your project's root directory and paste this:

```text
# --- API Keys & Secrets ---
.env
.env.local
.env.*
secrets.json

# --- Python Environment ---
venv/
env/
.venv/
bin/
lib/
include/

# --- AI & LLM Cache ---
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.pytest_cache/
.ruff_cache/
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# --- Project Specific Outputs ---
# Only uncomment the next line if you want to keep your 
# generated blogs private and NOT show them on GitHub.
# output/

# --- OS Specific ---
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

```

### 💡 Pro-Tips for Security

#### 1. The `.env.example` Trick

Since you are ignoring `.env`, other people who download your code won't know which keys they need. Create a file called `.env.example` and commit it to GitHub. It should look like this:

```text
# .env.example - Copy this to .env and fill in your keys
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
SERPER_API_KEY=

```

*This allows others to see the **labels** without seeing your **private keys**.*

#### 2. "I accidentally already pushed my keys!"

If you committed your `.env` file *before* creating the `.gitignore`, Git is already tracking it. Adding it to `.gitignore` now won't remove it from GitHub. You must run this command to "untrack" it:

```bash
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove sensitive .env file from tracking"
git push

```

#### 3. Use GitHub Secrets for Deployment

If you eventually deploy this agent to a server (like Heroku or Vercel), don't upload your `.env` file there either. Use the platform's **Environment Variables** or **GitHub Secrets** settings to securely inject your keys at runtime.

**Would you like me to help you set up a GitHub Action that automatically runs your "Reviewer Agent" every time you push new code?**
