To run this complete agentic workforce in 2026, you need a precise set of libraries. As of early 2026, **CrewAI** and **LangChain** have optimized their integrations for Gemini 2.5 and 3.0 series models.

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project root and paste the following:

```text
# --- Core Agent Framework ---
crewai>=0.100.0
crewai-tools>=1.9.0

# --- LLM & Google Integration ---
langchain-google-genai>=4.2.0
google-genai>=1.0.0

# --- Environment & Utils ---
python-dotenv>=1.0.1
requests>=2.31.0

```

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Everything

Run this command in your terminal to set up your environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Configure Your Secrets

Create a `.env` file (ensure it is in the same folder as your `main.py`):

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key

```

### 3. Verify Your Python Version

Ensure you are using **Python 3.10 or higher**, as the 2026 versions of CrewAI utilize advanced type hinting and asynchronous features not supported in older versions.

## 🚀 One-Click Execution

With these requirements installed and your `main.py` ready, you can now run:

```bash
python main.py

```

### What happens next?

Your terminal will start showing the **"Thought Process"** of each agent:

* You'll see the **Researcher** calling the Serper API.
* You'll see the **Project Manager** delegating tasks when the Writer finishes.
* The final files will appear in your `/output` folder automatically.

** create a `.gitignore` file for you to ensure you don't accidentally leak your API keys when pushing this to GitHub?**
